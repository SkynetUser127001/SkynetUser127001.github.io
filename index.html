        <p style="text-align:right" >Hello, my name is Neil Goswami. Welcome to my website.
            I am currently a senior in Florida International University
            majoring in Information Technology(Software Track). I am 
            currently seeking a career in software development.
            This website is currently under construction, stay tuned
            though, as I will transform my personal page into something that
            is visually pleasing to the eye
